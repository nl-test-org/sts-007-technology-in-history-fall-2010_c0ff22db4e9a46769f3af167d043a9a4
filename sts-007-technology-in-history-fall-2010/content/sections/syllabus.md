Summary
-------

In this class we ask two big questions. First, what is "technology"? Second, how has the set of activities to which we commonly give this label shaped human relations among ourselves and with the rest of the natural world?

We focus on four fundamental transformations in these relations: the emergence of humankind as a history-making species; of agriculture-based civilizations; of productive systems based on fossil fuels; and of "human empire" dominated by human presence and power.

In each unit we will study, among other things, technologies as media of expression and communication; connections among technological, political, and military power; the concept of "technological revolutions"; and the role of imagination, beliefs, and values both in inspiring and in being shaped by technological creativity.

Because MIT is celebrating its 150th anniversary in 2011, we will focus on connections between MIT as an institution and technology in the history of the last 150 years.
